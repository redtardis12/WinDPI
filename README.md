# WinDPI
A simple python GUI for GoodbyeDPI

### This app is just a wrapper for [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI), all credit goes to wonderful people behind GoodbyeDPI!!!

After some recent Internet censorship politics in my country, I developed a need for a frequent usage of DPI filtering. So i made this app for my own personal convenience, as the original software lacks some features for Windows platform. Maybe this little app will be helpful for someone else.

## Features:
- running DPI filter app in background with no extra windows
- easy way to enable/disable the filter
- launch on Windows start-up
- some configuration options for editing blacklist
- change launch arguments

## How to use
#### Download the zip archive from the [latest release here](https://github.com/redtardis12/WinDPI/releases/tag/Init)
1. Extract the archive
2. Launch **WinDPI.exe**, an app icon will appear in the tray menu
3. The filter is working!
- To stop the filter - press right click on the tray icon and choose **"exit"**
- To configure the filter or enable auto start-up, choose **"open"**
